    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "In a world of changing climate, understanding the hydrologic cycle is crucial as water resources will continue to be stressed. However, quantifying fluxes within the hydrologic cycle has always been an extremely difficult task as they require us to define a space, make assumptions, and at times ignore parameters. Infiltration is one such flux that quantifies the amount of water from the ground surface entering into the soil and is especially important in providing insight into groundwater recharge, flood risk, and the risk of dissolved pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to study infiltration. In the field, hydrologists use infiltrometers and permeameters to take point measurements of the infiltration rate. Several models exist to model infiltration from the traditional, the Richards Equation presented here, which is based on the water balance equation to the modern Green-Ampt Model, which is based on a combination of the water balance equation and Darcy's Law.
